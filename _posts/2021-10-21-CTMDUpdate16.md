With the second runthrough, while ending on a higher reward the journey towards it gave notably lesser reward than the first run. This may be due to the agent becoming accustomed to the previous learning in terms of application for the current, however it does not seem very comfortable with the number of steps currently provided. In turn, these will be increased in order for the agent to explore and learn more throughout one session, possibly yielding a notable increase in reward.
