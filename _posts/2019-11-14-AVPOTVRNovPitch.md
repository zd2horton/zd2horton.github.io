The idea for the Oregon Trail VR Experience has now been expanded upon. The core idea of an on rail experience educating users about life during the Oregon Trail through puzzle solving gameplay is still present, and its aspects will mostly stay true to history unless alterations are required in areas. Users may begin their experience by either choosing a scene or beginning from a random scene allowing for pick up and play sessions, and will always involve an obstacle which an NPC in the convoy will relay hints for through text to speech, detailing a second if required. This text to audio technique in advance will use preproduced audio, helping the program itself save potential resources during runtime. Overall, the look based interactivity planned should distinguish the experience over other similar VR experiences that otherwise lack interactivity.

Users will also be able to choose the time or distance of their journey, or travel until the experience reaches ten minutes. To add, due to the experience's historical accuracy, there will also be a toggle for users to use if they wish to not witness more "intense" or graphic scenes. To further enthrall the user, any planned UI aspects will be diegetic like the audio is planned to be, meaning that it will be implemented as part of the experience itself and experienced by NPCs (for instance, a menu on a scroll of paper).

The experience will be developed for Oculus based platforms and through Unity, as they are generally compatible and create a manageable development space that would not cause much issue. As well as this, the previously mentioned look based interactivity also make the experience more user friendly as newer users may not be acquainted with controller or touch based interactivity in VR.

Overall, the audio of the experience will be atmospheric to help immerse the user in, and will be helped by various sounds that will add to the environment and give it life. These will need to be implemented such that the user would be able to turn to the sources of the audio and find the wildlife making the noise.

From here, more research will be required in order to form important aspects about the experience's appeal as well as its educative features. Information about the former should be available via undertaking primary research and asking potential consumers about ideal VR experiences, this information becoming important more so if they have not experienced the medium yet.
