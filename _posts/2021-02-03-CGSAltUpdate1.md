Continuing on from the previous ideas discussed, it has been reaffirmed that it is not possible to upload scripts from Unity, meaning that any may need to develop with the AltSpaceVR SDK using "A-Frame". This may impact the previous escape room idea, as while an idea proposed with the concept was a straight path filled with obstacles over a more maze like approach, the potential loss of procedurally generated mazes that may require unity scripts would impact replayability very negatively.  As well as this, creating such a system may also potentially be too complex for an alpha build, and may also obstruct other key features of the project. 

Further discussions have led to various ideas, one being a colosseum battle ground in which players pick objects up and throw them at other players in order to eliminate them with another being a dodgeball game. Both ideas carry a competitive nature and can be vastly replayable due to this but may not be very interesting or advantageous of AltSpaceVR, however many issues also come with these ideas. For example, the playability of them in a 2D setting may not be very optimal or equal with VR players as the method used for handling the situation with the mouse is not very intuitive. As well as this, the ability for moving objects colliding with players is also somewhat unreliable. From here, the dodgeball idea was expanded upon into a castle defense esque game in which two teams spend a setup phase building castles with various pieces before they attempt to destroy each others' creations via the dodgeball based attack phase.

Overall, this creates a more intuitive and interactive experience over the lone dodgeball idea, with replayability being owed to the diversity of both the difference in teams that play the game as well as how diverse the final creations can be. Teammates can discuss ideas on how to build their castles, and as the foundations are laid their creations will become more difficult to build if they wish to build higher. This introduces a sense of tactical thinking as well as a sense of flow, as the difficulty of the task will increase as the foundations are built upon. However, this also gives way to a number of problems, as an alternate method of jumping will need to be implemented due to AltSpaceVR's lack of it. While a more free sense of travel like flying can be introduced for the game, this would lower the tension and general interactivity notably as many players could simply choose to fly up close in order to destroy their opponents' castles. 
From here, the ideas will be debated on more and afterwards either a final game idea from the existing shall be chosen, or a new one may be created.
