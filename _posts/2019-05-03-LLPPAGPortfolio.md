Land of Gold is a 4 player card game in which the farmers must keep as much bits (money) and produce as possible, growing their produce the more time passes in hopes to be the most profitable.

This previous Play and Games board game has been remodelled and revamped as a network game. In each turn, players must give in produce respective of the turn number in order to get said amount of bits back (which can be increased with more produce), and move around the board, gaining useful (as well as the occasional unhelpful) card to help boost their bits and produce.

Some amount of suspense in the game in the form of attacking and losing early in have been removed, though while a large part of the Play and Games version doing as such has created a far more streamlined, understandable and relaxing experience. The digitalised version is also more accessible due to the lack of perhaps tedious counting present before, as well as due to the introduction of a board format.
