Land of Gold is a 4 player card game in which the farmers must keep as much bits (money) and produce as possible, growing their produce the more time passes in hopes to be the last standing.

Land of Gold is a network game, and a remodelling of our previous Play and Games board game. In each turn, players must give in produce respective of the turn number in order to get said amount of bits back (which can be increased with more produce), and then attack a player to draw a card. If successful, they will take the produce wagered by the defender and also draw a card, buying it if able to and using it to their advantage when needed (for instance, a slime meat card which can help boost produce).
