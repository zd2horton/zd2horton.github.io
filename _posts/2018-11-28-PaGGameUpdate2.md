After various playtests, we have found and ironed out many issues. The biggest problem involving the elimination of players in the early stages of the game has been global cards: powerful events that can hinder progress. For example, the flood global event will cause all players to lose 10 bits. To counteract the power of these cards, the initial produce gain was set to 3, however this proved to instead make the players too powerful. As a result, the produce gain was decreased to 1, balancing the game more fairly.

Another factor dampening the experience was that in the beginning of a game, even without global events, the bank would take too much produce from players and still eliminate them early. This was due to players being unable to afford cards which in turn would give them produce, so in order to fix this problem the number of bits given to players initially has been increased to 20 instead of the previous 10. This in turn is also the price of sabotage cards, cards that can be drawn from the global deck and can attack target players making them lose bits, happiness or produce. As such, as they are incredibly powerful, players should not be able to buy them early in the game. 

Playtests criticised the lack of player interaction, so we have have included attacking. This happens before a player draws a card, with them needing to win an attack in order to draw. The player must choose another to attack, and wager up to 5 produce which the defender can choose to match up to in their own produce. Both players then roll a number dice equal to the amount of produce they wagered. Happiness is used here, and dictates how many times the attacker can reroll (if on 4 happiness, the attacker can reroll their dice 4 times). After comparing all dice, the player with the more wins (comparing highest roll to highest roll, lowest to lowest etc) takes the produce bet by both ends. As a result, if the attacker loses, they cannot draw.
