Learning through the sensors and randomly placed blocks has been progressing well overall, with added code rewarding the agent accordingly whether they are going towards or away from the target. This reward is minimal but noticeable enough in where it does not skew the usual reward mean shown through statistics, but also influences the agent into going a certain direction. Likewise with previous attempts, initial results continued to climb well. However, with a newer batch performance seemed to take a fall thus incentivising the comparison of overall stats recorded with each run. 

The given statistics for each, ranging from the initial step run to the first, second and third gap attempts

With the given values, the most notable areas were the entropy and beta and learning rates due to their heavy decline and extremely small figures respectively. In response, beta was increased due to the entropy's drops and its own low values, while the epsilon and learning rates were decreased in order to give more stable updates. This heavily succeeded and verified the changes as beneficial, causing most subsequent runs to place inbetween the 0.8 to 0.97 reward mean area. Runs 31 and 25 were able to reach levels of 0.99+, causing them to be the most optimal of the runs currently. However, due to time left, focus should instead be kept on implementing the optimal runs with the level layouts.
