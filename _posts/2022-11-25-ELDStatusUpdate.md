Though the project has been on a lengthy hiatus, I am still incredibly invested in it and will now be continuing with it in tandem the Retro Party Project. Most of the time away from the project has been due to the Masters course, with most focus being on such especially with such areas as dissertation work, while most of 2022 has been spent with overall external matters. 

World 2 has been completed for some time since the break, though upon revisiting the levels in order to return to the flow of level design I have found that the content must be made more lenient and fair as currently it seems very demanding for a hypothetical game aimed for most players. Therefore, alterations to pre-existing content (most specifically World 1) will be made before progress on World 3 is made, with World 2 and a revamped World 1 planned to have overview videos for their overall content while World 3 updates will be made per level as to allow more detail and analysis to be made on each level.
