This task required picking a game mechanic and simplifying it to its fundamentals, analysing and showing the logic of its functionality through ideas such as psuedocode and Finite State Machines. I chose 
Super Mario World's Cape Feather power-up and provided an in depth analysis on its workings, as well as including a flowchart 
along with psuedocode and a Finite State Machine. Due to the assignment's extremely analytical nature, I found it both interesting and entertaining to work on.
