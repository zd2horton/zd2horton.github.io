As the theme of the hypothesis and research question mentioned in the proposal was to simply evaluate the success and usability of a feedback-oriented system, the current research question has been narrowed down to the effectiveness of a feedback-oriented system in generating game content against human-made game content. As the question has an overall more concentrated scope, time can be more easily allocated to more vital aspects, and context can be provided to the otherwise overly broad hypothesis from before. As well as this, it also gives larger purpose to the intended side by side testing by linking it to the main question. In turn, the academic research required for evaluation will span both procedurally generated rules, patterns and examples as well as those created by developers, which consequently can shed light on areas that the system and its examples potentially succeed at more than designers, with some areas even likely being impossible for content created outside of an algorithm.

In terms of current research, reading is being undertaken with a book named "PyTorch Deep Learning Hands-On: Apply modern AI techniques with CNNs, RNNs, GANs, reinforcement learning, and more". This book includes a large amount of information on neural networks and machine learning as a whole, while also connecting to elements learned in Advanced Technologies' Neural Network assignment (which used CNNs and GANs).
