This module seems interesting to me as it does not seem to rely largely on programming like others, but rather through production of a video output as the name suggests through using effects and video editing. Out of the modules presented this year, this seems to be the most unique.

The first session of AVP had us use the Oculus Quest VR sets in order to place a Unity scene in VR. The technology after some troubleshooting seems simple to work with, and we were mostly successful in placing a simple Unity scene into the set though we still required the controllers to move in the Unity World. If similar assignments with the Quest are presented in the future I believe I will be able to develop using Oculus hardware fairly comfortably.
