The second task for Game Development Evolution was an evolution timeline for a selected feature that is now prominent in video games. I researched around the topic of Metal Gear's Stealth feature which incorporated unique AI behaviours. The task was interesting to research into, but I consider this piece to be my weakest from the selection of my Game Development Evolution work.
