As of current, all four beginning row tiles have been implemented. The temple tile has been appropriately made the third in order to coincide with the new second tile, which allows the player to grow accustomed to the more hilly and challenging terrain that could await them. As well as this, the tile has also been given some more interactivity through remnants of a crashed ship and some stone arcs, as the player may choose to travel through or avoid them in the case of either free roaming or an objective. In turn, the temple tile has also been balanced to be more approachable for low energy or beginning players through lowering the height of the mountains, this being notably important as the tile is near the opening area. With the fourth tile in the row, a more relaxed approach similar to the first was taken so it could act as a "break area" of sorts if the player had navigated to it through either the entire first row or from elsewhere. It includes a variety of areas such as mountains and arcs to navigate about by leisure, while the terrain itself is mildly bumpy. From here, parts of the areas may be coloured as to avoid monotony, and if needed applicable balance could be applied.
