Our next assignment is a group project linked to the sci fi movie Ex Machina, in which the line between man and AI becomes blurred. The idea of a group project sounds very appealing to me as it reflects an industry level scenario in which a programmer must work in a larger team in order to program a complete game. The upcoming elevator pitch and booth esque demo showcase also seem interesting as they could help develop presentational skills, another aspect that is extremely vital for in the industry to help spark interest in others about potential ideas.
