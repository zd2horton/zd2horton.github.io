During our time exploring potential board game ideas, our team decided on a selection of 3. They were a robot game in which players aim for the head in the middle of the board and dodge others in order to return to their base, a farming game in which players gain money to spend on produce methods with an array of obstacles (pictured below) and a spying game, the latter of which was the least developed and therefore considered by the group to be the weakest of the three. After our presentation, we found that the robot game was potentially too short for a half an hour playthrough as well as being less bountiful in possibilities compared to the farming game. We believe that the farming idea will become the board game we create due to the simplicity yet longevity of the game in addition to the broad variety of topics it can cover in its gameplay such as battery farming (we are possibly exploring the idea of a fantasy setting for the game so that themes inside do not become too morbid for children to play) and external factors like Brexist affecting bank loaning to farmers.
