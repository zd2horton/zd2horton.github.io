As mentioned in the previous update, the decks for the other players have been added. However, I noticed that when shuffled, the beginning of the deck always presented "Farmland", "Mass Breeding", and then a species specific card for all players, even after multiple launches of the game. This was due to the shuffling instruction being seeded using "std::mt19937(std::random_device()())", a uniformly distributed generator which would always shuffle the deck the same way. Using a seed generated by the time passed since the clock's epoch manages to shuffle the deck differently each time for each player, solving the problem entirely. 

Different decks shuffled randomly and correctly:
