After a meeting with the dissertation supervisor, a large amount of feedback has been given on the research question front. A warranted hypothesis has been recommended, with a broad vague question being asked that can evolve over time (with the evaluation always linking back to it). As well as this, the main qualities being assessed are the ability to run a project, writing, thinking about and setting up a situation and experiment with a timeline and basic research, as these are appealing for potential clients. Being specific in all things was also highlighted, alongside the point of applying critical thinking to oneself.

Emphasis was placed on the material, with critique on it (such as the source, why some points are more important, if it's all true and how to form something from it all in terms of the hypothesis and implementation) being mentioned specfically mentioned due to the importance of the module's learning and thinking based nature as well as the formal assessment piece itself. This also entails searching for other examples done by writers in the general area (procedural generation), and concluding on if they are useful for the project.

Project related aspects past the "big why" and enjoyability were also discussed, such as the benefits of such a system. These ranged from the new and different level creation the system could perform past human creation due to knowing the game more intensely, creating large amounts of content out of small algorithms, creating content faster, infinite content and overall new experiences for players. This also led into talks about the testing, still mentioning the concept of hand crafting a handful of levels and letting the system craft an equal amount before letting players test each and see what each test would implicate (measuring engagement with playability and enjoyability, and if players knew a computer had created the content). 

However, despite this, it was mentioned not to "get lost in the programming" as it was stressed to review progress in both practical implementation and research with the former being a means for the latter. With this, it was also mentioned that the aspects identified and looked at in depth should also be explored if they could match another thing, and even just base research should be done into Reinforcement Learning to begin with (and continually build up from there). This also entailed the advice of overviewing each aspect found and measuring its advantages and disadvantages.
