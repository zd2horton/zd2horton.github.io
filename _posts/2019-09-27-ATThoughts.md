Advanced Technologies seems very interesting to me as DirectX will be an integral aspect of it, meaning that I will be learning the tool from scratch and the skills that I will learn from doing so will also help me establish myself in the industry due to the value of DirectX skills.

Each week I will be required to research and develop an idea, and document my progress with a one minute commentated video. This will also help me improve as I have been very reluctant before to provide voiced commentary for my progress videos, however I will be required to in this module which in turn should gradually improve my confidence in doing so.

For the current project, there are three options from a sim game, procedural plant generation and a 3d platforming game, which will be the area I will be undertaking. I wholeheartedly believe that I will find this assignment incredibly enjoyable due to platforming being the game genre I wish to develop most for, meaning that I will be able to build upon my skills for that area in this assignment.
