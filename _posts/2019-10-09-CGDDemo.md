The final game was showcased today alongside others, and while the final product was reasonably good, it could have been a lot better. While mechanics such as the honk and item holding features were successfully implemented, the game could have done with more levels and fleshing out.

A major contributor to this was a slight lack of communication within the team, overall causing a confusing atmosphere based on what tasks have been done and how they mesh together. The other games however, seemed to accomplish more so I would say for the next project an aim for the team would be to co-ordinate better.
