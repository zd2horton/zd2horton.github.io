The final assignment is the group project, which will bring all previous assignments together. It will be at least three minutes long with three levels, using different themes and playstyles for each. After discussion in my group, I will be pioneering the third and final level, which will take a more puzzle esque route. I believe this will open up many possibilities for creative ways to merge features together, and create an interesting experience.
