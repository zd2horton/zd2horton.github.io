Feedback has been given on initial writeups, mostly focused on how technical algorithm implementation would take place as well as possible feedback structures. For instance, more depth can be found in the playtests with not only interviews and opinions (such as asking if they believe a computer had generated the level) but also noting how volunteeers played and creating groups with and without algorithms that improve the level's quality. As well as this, "Procedural Level Design for Platform Games" by Kate Compton and Michael Mateas goes into similar analysis of a platforming level with it being a sequence of various other smaller challenges. The paper goes further on to mention rhythm and as such flow in a level, both being majorly important to the enjoyment of content while also helping with clearing obstacles. As well as this, various patterns are noted ranging from the use of a single object to a larger number and patterns combining components so that a player requires a different action to approach them (e.g: timed obstacle jumps). Findings such as these can assist in understanding the current project, as well as giving more context into more technical aspects of it.
