Currently, sprites are able to be rendered to the game and there is an established array of rooms that the player is able to go to from their current room. A large obstacle that faced us was the overcomplication of implementing sprites, as the previously included SpriteComponent class was not present in the base commit. As a result, the team unaminously thought that another, self made method was required, which caused a lot of time to be invested in trying ways to do so. However, none of these ideas worked, and after finding out that SpriteComponent was again the correct class to implement, we are able to progress at a much quicker rate than before.
