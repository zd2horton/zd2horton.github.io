As of the moment, the outline for the Binary Space Partitioning has been created. A function at the beginning makes sure that the current area doesn't have children before deciding what way to split it, then creating two children from the split using limits decided by what way the area is cut. From here, the children need to be assigned values from this as well as drawn onto the plane.
