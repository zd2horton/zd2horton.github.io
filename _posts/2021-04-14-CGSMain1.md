For the session, the next workstream's idea has been pitched with the final project to pitch being Cloak. This is due to the potential of the game as well as the implementation of cross device communication. As for developments in previous works, debate was placed onto perhaps leaving Apex Drive (Rickshaw Rumble) as an alpha in order to give more focus onto Cloak and crafting it into a much more presentable portfolio piece. However, this would also involve developing AltSpaceVR's project into beta, which did not seem to be a very well understood assignment for the programmers in the group. As well as this, the fate of Cloak itself is also undetermined as of current, and could very much change to be far less desirable for a game to develop into a gold status. Thus, decisions on this matter will be discussed at a later date, presumably when all three games have reached an alpha stage.
