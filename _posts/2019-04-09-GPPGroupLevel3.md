For our group project, I was allocated the final level of the game. For this, I created a slightly slower paced, more puzzle and thinking oriented level. The beginning of the level holds a switch that the player must press in order to open the door ahead, then needing to climb down a flight of platforms in order to reach the door and the next room. The next room features two large slimes which must be defeated to get to the next area, this being the slowest part of the level due to needing to weave around and avoid the smaller slimes that appear once the bigger slimes die. The final area of the level is a Simon Says puzzle, in which the player is shown a colour combination they must recreate using the coloured platforms in front of them and the double jump. If unsuccessful, their health will deduct and they will need to try again, however succeeding will open the door beyond the puzzle and win the game. 
The level uses an array of features in combination, more analysis into these available here:
