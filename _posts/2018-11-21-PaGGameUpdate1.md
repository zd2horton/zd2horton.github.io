We have settled on the name of "Land of Gold" for our game, adopting a fantasy theme. Each player is in charge of a species represented by player cards, and at the beginning of each turn give in produce equal to the current turn number while also receiving bits (money) for doing so and being given back produce equal to their produce gain.

The bits can be used to purchase cards drawn from a player's deck, which in turn can increase produce, produce gain, happiness or a mix of any for a player. The game is over once only one person remains with sufficent produce. However, at the moment the game can end early due to the rising costs for players being too much, eliminating them easily. Due to this, we need to balance the game so that players can last longer.

The mandrake playing field, with bits represented by lined paper and other pieces representing produce:
