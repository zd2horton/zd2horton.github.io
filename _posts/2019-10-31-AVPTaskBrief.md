Our main assignment has now been detailed to be seated VR content no longer than 10 minutes which can act as a gateway for those who do not know much about VR, showing them the potential of VR as an art form. The briefing was headed by Catherine Allen, the CEO and co-founder of Liminia, a firm based in Bristol that creates and offers various immersive media experiences including VR and have worked with companies such as the BBC. Emphasis was placed on intuitive experiences for a newer audience, due to their inexperience with the genre of media, which is also especially important when considering interaction in the experience.

There was also a lot of emphasis on the experience itself, each user having their own personal experience which they could say they had. With this, spacial immersion (feeling), mental immersion (a tactical, narrative and trance like absorbing immersion) and simulation (pretend) were also covered in depth.

The exercise given afterwards was a group task to make an immersive maker tool for professional athletes. An immersive maker tool is one of various content formats that creators can take inspiration from, and here it was implemented for the idea of a visualised fitness plan and tracker in which the user can share and look at plans, as well as other aspects such as calories burned and meal plans.

For next week, we are required to form our teams for the task and prepare three ideas for elevator pitch style presentation (one of which will be taken further as the task itself and be used for a pitch presentation) as well as allocate roles based on our skill sets.
