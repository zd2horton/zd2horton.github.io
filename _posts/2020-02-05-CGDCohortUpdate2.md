Progress has been made on the vending machine event, which is the minor event given to the sub-team I am in. As there is currently no established code formatting for events yet, aspects of how the event will be implemented have been planned out. Interacting or walking near the machines will cause them to fall, though if it takes time to fall it will lightly shake while heavy shaking will occur if the machine chooses to fall nearly instantaneously. As the machines will be placed near the wall they will not be able to fall backwards, however plans are to make them fall either downwards or to the sides depending on how the machine is approached or interacted with. From here, they will act as an obstacle that will block the PAWNS path or kill them if they are standing directly where the vending machine will fall, and requires maintenance to remove. From here, progress towards programming the event or at the very least writing up psuedocode can be made.
