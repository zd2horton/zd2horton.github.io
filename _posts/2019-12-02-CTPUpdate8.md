After a large amount of researching general implementation of Perlin Noise, I have begun to work on my own implementation. Currently, nothing is showing up on the plane used for outputting the maps but the general frame of the code is in and just needs to be drawn onto the plane. Once fully implemented, the samples for each octave will be take, and the Perlin Noise will be generated using the samples through a specialised Unity command (MathF.PerlinNoise). To add, work is now beginning on the research report, which will encompass all of the research done over the last few months.
