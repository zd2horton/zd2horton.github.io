A second presentation on the project has been given, this team spectated by Catherine Allen (the client). It expands on the first presentation, however gives more information on the target audience and the overall historical accuracy of the project, as well as the production cycle and a demonstration of a work in progress scenario. Overall, the project seems to have been received well however a point of improvement was made towards the voice used, which was text to speech and initially marketed as such in the initial presentation. A valid point was presented in that voice acting would make for a more natural and less jarring experience, which would certainly help immersion. From this, voice acting can definitely be an aim to work towards.
