A leaderboard outputting each player's score and the inability to tap the cube's buttons after a player's time is over have been implemented, so that respectively a winner is able to be deduced and players are unable to add more points to their score after their turn is over. As well as this, more playtesting was conducted at the Pizza Playtest event held. 

The general consenus found the game to be satisfactory in quality in its current state, and liked the overall AR theme as well as implemented audio visual feedback from tapping the cube's buttons. Some pointers for improvement were given, such as stablising the cube as well as more audio visual cues (including improvements on existing ones such as volume adjustments), general explanation of how to play as well as UI improvements. Many also gave improvements honing in on the UI, such as button rearrangement for accessibility, more prounounced touch areas, better readability and better clarity against harsher backgrounds.

Generally, the biggest concern was communication to players, which can be fixed by giving text prompts upon events such as when to pass to the next player, what the player needs to do to win and an ongoing score shown on the screen. Given this problem and an assortment of previously mentioned issues, all playtesters stated themselves as mostly unwilling to play the game again in its current state, but would be very likely to play the game again if improved. This would rely mostly on giving the players a more informative and interactive experience, as it would be clearer for them on how to play which would result in more enjoyment. UI improvements such as using harsher colours on buttons for clarity would also make the game more appealing, as it would strengthen communication between the game and the players.
