At the moment, I have fully implemented the town segment of the level in which the player can talk to NPCs and climb the building in order to get to the corridor. The first involves a jump off the boat onto the island and talking to NPCs to find out where to go next, and then jumping to the building which can be climbed and entered. From there the player picks up a double jump power up which is used to progress through the corridor section, involving platforming requiring the double jump.

I have used a lot of different features of Unreal through this work that I did not know about before, such as sequencing for moving platforms, and dialogue paths. Overall, I am finding this a very interesting learning experience and look forward to implementing the rest of the project.
