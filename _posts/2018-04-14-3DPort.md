Overall, Principles of 3D Environments was a module that went well but could have been improved. The first task involved creating a tank using the skills learned in Maya, as well as creating an animation showing the mechanics of such factors like the treads, the turret and the wheels.  The final result that I concluded with was not abysmal, but could certainly use some improving. 
The second portfolio task implemented the tank into a given island environment, including new features such as a journey to to the tank, a tank driving mode and obstacles for weapons to destroy. Due to my larger understanding of Unity compared to Maya, I had a much more enjoyable and relaxing time working on this. 

I created three weapons for the tank, each assigned to a separate obstacle. For instance, the guideline suggested a "joke weapon", so in return I created a bread obstacle which could only be destroyed via firing robins at it. The morst worrysome feature for me to work on was getting the turret of the tank to properly function and aim as a result of my previous work. I eventually managed to find a solution by locking the turret's movement behind the aiming mode and then resetting its position after, as there is lesser use in aiming the turret outside of the mode. In order to improve were I given the assignments again, I would research further into Maya and only begin once I would fully understand it.
