As of current, a basis for the level has been crafted. Many layouts were considered from a square like structure with five different rooms to a tree branch esque setup, however the final design has been created in order to closely resemble a spacecraft's potential structure. As well as this, craft such as those used for the Apollo 11 mission were researched into in order to deduce possible areas the level design itself could involve while overall spacecraft map designs contributed to the layout. Locations are placed across the craft with the majority carrying potential spots for tasks, as well as giving open spaces and corridors for enemy based encounters. This also comes with potential obstacles that players and the enemy will have to traverse, such as beds and tables in the communal areas and the open space itself as they in more intense moments will need to find optimal paths in an initiated chase. Currently rooms have been specified, however in terms of progress more research and discussion with those dictating gameplay tasks can be undertaken in order to specify the designs of the rooms overall and thus the tasks that may entail from them.
