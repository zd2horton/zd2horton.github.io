The task at hand, as well as requiring information on a game's methods of implementing online multiplayer, also requested explanation of possible issues that can be found with said methods. As such, I explained Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS' Peer to Peer networking methods and how its necessary data is transferred to and from Nintendo 3DS systems in addition to the overlying problems of Nintendo using said architecture for a game demanding precise, quick inputs. I believe that from a choice of this and the preceding pieces, this is the strongest of the trio due to its more analytical and balanced nature.
