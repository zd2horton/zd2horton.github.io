Our team, Team Riviera, has created three seperate and unique ideas for a gateway VR experience. A boat ride esque experience is the first, creating a gentle experience for the user in which they can travel through a themed area as if on a calm theme park ride.  As well as providing an enjoyable ride experience at home, it can also be used for those who are unable to access a resort to ride for themselves, such as those who are too far away to travel or those who may be disabled or hospitalised. To add, the numerous themes available would also diversify the overall experience if used many times.

Another experience involves the user searching through a hall of doorways and rooms, using the VR headset's degrees of freedom to find pieces of the next area's door in a puzzler esque interactive experience. Due to the simplicity of the interactivity, it can be easy for those using VR for the first time to pick up and play. Overall, this idea is geared towards those using VR for the first time and are interested in seeing its potential.

The final idea, an Oregon Trail esque experience, was recommended as the idea after the presenation to further flesh out due to its potential and more rounded premise. In this, the user leads a convoy on horseback in an on rails trek through areas of the Oregon Trail, and must use their VR capabilities to solve obstacles by looking around the environment to find solutions (for instance, if there is a gap with no way to cross, the user can look at a tree which can then fall to provide a bridge). This interactivity implements the puzzle solving aspects and user friendliness of the previous idea in order to create an educational and insightful experience that the user can become immersed in. This idea as a result has the most potential and could create the most enjoyable experience from the ideas present.

Riviera also has a number of assets that can assist in creating the experience, including low poly assets in order to create a colourful, appealing atmosphere that would be able to create a sense of immersion without intrusion. Text to speech would benefit the Oregon Trail Experience, as it could assist players further with problem solving and can also educate them about the Oregon Trail. Due to my prior experience with audio editing and recording, I will be responsible for the majority of the experience's audio elements. The next requirement will be to flesh out a selected idea more for a pitch presentation, with the Oregon Trail experience being the most likely to be expanded upon.
