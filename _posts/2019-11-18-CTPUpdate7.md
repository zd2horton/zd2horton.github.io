Implementation of Binary Space Partitioning was looked into this week, which was done through an article named "Dungeon Generation using Binary Space Trees". Their method involves a square area being cut repeatedly into smaller areas using limits before drawing the end results on screen, and is very similar to what is intended for the project which in turn can make it a decent basis to draw ideas from for implementation.
