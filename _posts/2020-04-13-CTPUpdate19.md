At the moment, more areas are now drawn onto the plane, but many of the areas travel off of the plane. This was done through adding the processed areas to a different array, and adding the final tree entries to this array for drawing. Initially, some of the areas were extremely far away from the plane and thus the co-ordinates were pushed back by 500 due to the planes' own co-ordinates (-500, -500 to 500, 500). From here, it seems to be a scaling issue, which will be looked into so that each area does not clash with the plane.
