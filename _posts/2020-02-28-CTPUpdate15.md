In a recent meeting, a more rational way of going about the project was discussed. Rather than using parts of the split map to place a full dungeon into, the idea was discussed of placing rooms into different parts to create a single dungeon with difficulty based on the height of each segment. This would create more of a link between all three aspects (Perlin Noise, A*, BSP) and also shed the need to generate entire dungeons for each space, which generally seems more sensible to do.
