In terms of code structure, the Leaf class now only holds the leaf data, and a LeafSplit script has been made instead to handle leaf splitting. As a result, the tree script has been altered to fit this and uses a boolean check for the splitting before letting the children be added to the tree. However, once the play button is pressed Unity freezes. This may be due to the splitting continuing on infinitely, and will need to be looked into.
