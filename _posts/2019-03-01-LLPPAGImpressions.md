The upcoming assignment in Low Level Programming is to recreate our Play and Games board game in ASGE, with network play. I think this will go well, as not only was our team's game easy to understand at its core but as a team we had various and consistent meetings which paved the way for clarity and good communication within the team.

The game, Land of Gold, should be ported without any problems due to its turn based nature, fitting in perfectly with the required networking aspect. Supporting up to 4 players, it is the farmers' (players') jobs to be the one with the most produce and bits, or outsurvive everyone else over the course of the increasingly harsh half hour to an hour playtime. 

While well recieved overall, a criticism that was given was that an aspect of the game named "produce gain" would be confused with "produce", meaning that sometimes a player could purchase a playing card they think could increase produce gain, but instead increases produce. This is one of many points that can be addressed in this new rendition, as well as the benefit of easier bit and produce management thanks to potential variables that would house the values for players rather than requiring them to remember.
