After looking through the code, the issue that caused Unity to keep freezing seemed to be the fact that even after splitting an area, it was kept in the tree's array. As the loop would continue splitting the contents, it would continuously split the same areas as they themselves are not trimmed and instead are showed to be split via their children, thus making for an infinite loop. Removing the processed areas from the partitioning tree fixed the infinite loop, but seems to have very small room sizes with the array contents. This most likely can be fixed by playing around with the minimum leaf size, and will be fixed. 

As things will be running fine on the code side, focus can now shift to drawing the resulting areas. While I have a basic idea of how to do this (creating a flat cube for each area and placing in the co-ordinates), it might need to be built upon once fully implemented.
