Buttons have been implemented into the cube, represented by coloured blocks which can be tapped by players. A button to switch to the next player has also been implemented, letting the players switch once their turn is over. More playtesting has taken place, and while the general aspect of AR was liked, many players needed explanation on how the game was played due to the lack of ingame prompts.
