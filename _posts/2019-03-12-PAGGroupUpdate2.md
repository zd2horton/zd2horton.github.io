Our final game idea is a Simon Says esque Pass the Bomb game in which players take turns pressing buttons on the "bomb" in the required orders under a time limit, the bomb exploding and deducting a point from the current player if an incorrect button is pressed. As it is a timed competitive game with the highest scoring player winning, it encourages interactivity between the player and the game. Currently, ARCore is being used however it is proving to be incompliant specifically on the computer used in the studio as it keeps disconnecting the phone used. Once this can be subverted, proper development can begin.
