Overall, the playtests of Land of Gold have benefitted it a lot and created a very balanced and enjoyable game for up to four players. However, the notable criticism previous playtests and the final playtest had was that the game incorporated too much counting. This problem is deeply rooted into the game as counting is required at the beginning of every turn, meaning that if counting were to be reduced the game's mechanics would need to be altered considerably. A problem such as this would be absent in a computer game, as tasks such as counting produce to give into the bank and recieving bits back would be automated so that players would not need to take time to do so. An example of this would be video game editions of Monopoly, in which the purchasing and handling of properties and houses is sorted near instantaneously.
