As well as locating more sounds to use in later scenarios, various attempts were made to record using a ZOOM Recorder. Using a 4channel setting, the audio quality is extremely high however as the recorder picks up even the quietest of sounds it proved to be extremely difficult to get "appropriate" recordings. This is apparent in one of the recordings where the ambiance of birds singing is of higher quality than the content already implemented, but the wind noises are a lot more apparent on the recorder and almost entirely mask the other sounds. If audio is to be recorded in the future (which will also need to be done quickly, as the loan time on the recorders is very short), then preparations will need to be made to find a location where it can be recorded without any disruption whatsoever.
