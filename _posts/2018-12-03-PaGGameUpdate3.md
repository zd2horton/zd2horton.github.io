Overall, the game's quality has been polished noticably. Bits and produce now have distinguishable representations to avoid confusion (fake dollars and counters respectively) and more player interaction has been added with curiosity cards, which are drawn from the global deck and are bid on by all players starting at 5 bits. These cards when played give increases to a player's specific stat, and encourage strategy. This also helps balance global cards, as adding more cards to the global deck can decrease the chance of finding a possibly fatal global card early in.

As well as this, attacking has been overhauled so it is more fair for the defending player. Rather than letting the attacker roll all dice as many times corresponding to their happiness, the attacker must choose one to reroll and can reroll it as many times as their happiness allows. This stops the attacker potentially turning a possible defender win into a full successful attack on all their dice thanks to a large reroll, making the system unfair. To add, some species are also able to increase a chosen diceroll by a fraction whether they are an attacker or defender (for example, dragons can add 1 onto an attack roll). After balancing the game through these aspects, most playtests have run without many problems.
