As of now, the project seems presentable gameplay wise. The main game mechanic of capturing the creatures has been implemented, and uses a timer of two minutes in order to ask the player with catching 5 creatures. Progress with animations after the previous rigging error has gone well, however there were difficulties on implementing a rotating camera around the player to commend capturing an enemy, similar to Ape Escape. As a result, a very simple animation was created through the animator and changes in the camera's position, which admittedly has caused a very strange looking animation. This will be an aspect of the game to improve upon, as well as the particle effects used while capturing.

The capturing device uses a pair of similar particle effects, where one is triggered upon aiming and the other upon capturing. The most difficult issue to solve thus far has been to get the effects to function properly with the device and the hypothetical nozzle it would have, which has caused them to output far different to their original appearances. However, overall the animation system and game itself along with a stylised menu all function very well.
