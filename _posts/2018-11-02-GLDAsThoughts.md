The assignment given in Game Level Design is a 4 minute long "weird fiction" Unreal 3rd person platformer. It will have a structure with four areas and looks like something I could be creative with. While I am currently focusing entirely on Low Level Programming at the moment, I will be beginning this assignment very soon after. My progress with Unity is also coming along smoothly.
