Currently, potential plans have been written for each of the three tasks. Though the current game rooted in impact, First Past the Past has had a lot implemented about it, the emphasis on appealing to those in earlier years of voting has been increased as the project may assist in raising interest in voting for them. To coincide this the project would also include visualisation on how results may change if more early aged voters participated, as well as potentially a point based mode to increase interactivity. As research found that voters of 18 to 24 years old were the group with the smallest turnout in a number of elections, the project should be able to appeal heavily to those who have not voted very much and as a result may not be as invested in doing so.

For the Bio-Rover, due to the client's request of the game demonstrating its adaptive nature, a collectathon style approach has been documented. This would involve deliberately placed collectables around a set of challenging environments requiring players to use the Rover's attributes in order to obtain, giving a sense of flow throughout with increasingly difficult locations while also managing to showcase the Rover's own capabilities with this. As well as this, if accurate enough with the depiction of the Bio-Rover, the project may also be used for simulations by more scientific individuals more invested in the rover itself. While there was not much research available based on the Bio-Rover itself, methodologies for pre-existing collectathons were compiled and analysed into, conveying how intentional the general level design of such games can be. 

As for the Centre of Music brief, exploring the Centre itself in an experience would emphasise quality of each feature as well as the audio implementation. These aspects, as well as a newcomer friendly system for those being introduced to even playing music itself, would be extremely high priority in implementation and ensuring an enjoyable experience for players. Systems could also be placed to filter their tastes through questions and thus suggest features or instruments for them to attempt if they are unsure on what to do. Overall, concepts such as these leading up to an immersive and informative experience should assist in spreading the word of the Centre of Music and make it more known in the public student eye.

Though the most ideal would be First Past the Post in order to continue working on and refining the currently implemented systems, the Bio-Rover project may present the potential to work with aspects closer to more familiar grounds such as player abilities and level design. As well as this, it would also be able to showcase a developing technology and create further projects oriented around it be others. While the Centre of Music project may refine skills in audio implementation and also prove to be an interesting implementation in VR, being assigned it feels as though it is a lesser priority than the other two projects detailed before it.
