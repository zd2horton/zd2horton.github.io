Further developments have been done to allow manipulation of the Rover via a light source, now using a system placed into effect by another group member which creates a RayCast towards the Rover. Once placed above ground, the caustics can now be used to push the Rover away in a slow manner. Adding torque rather than applying the Vector also seems to help in not overriding any potential external force given. From here, further refinements will be made to optimise the response and could potentially also use more accurate means.
