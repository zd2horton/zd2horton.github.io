As of now, notes have been taken on what sounds are required for scenarios 2 and 3, as well as potential sounds for scenario 4. Scenario 2 is a town trading scene with various merchants around in a desert like area so as well as trudging audio for sand there will also need to be chatter audio in order to populate the town and various sounds reflecting their work (e.g livestock and tinkering/working audio). Scenario 3 is a scene in which the wagon will suddenly lose control in a snowy mountainous landscape, which will also down the line give them a choice of taking a safer route guarded by bandits, or take the more dangerous route which will in turn result in the wagon repair scenario. From here, as well as the appropriate terrain audio change harsh wind can be implemented, alongside more intense audio such as a more rickety out of control wagon and horse winnying for the dangerous segments and appropriate audio like small chatter and smoke for the bandit segment.

In addition to this, a TASCAM recorder will also be borrowed in order to record audio for such things like selected wagon audio. Doing this may result in more preferable audio, and will promote more technical work in order to make it presentable.
