After a supervisor meeting, it has been agreed to let the agent learn with far smaller and gradual steps than current through the default configuration, such as beginning with 1 block to jump over initially before moving onto 2 and 3 before showcasing gaps. The prior learning will then be incorporated into the next, helping with overall understanding and ideally making learning more efficient. As resuming is used for halted processes rather than usage of previous examples, initialisation is instead being used for the task. While learning went smoothly for the initial run, it did not grow too close to an optimal state and thus will be built from.
