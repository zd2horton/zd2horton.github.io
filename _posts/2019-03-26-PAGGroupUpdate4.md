Development of the game has been going well, as the AR codebase has become more understandable. However, ARCore has been replaced with Vuforia (a card/image based AR system) due to previously mentioned difficulties as well as inaccessibility of ARCore Elements. Almost immediately, Vuforia has proved to be more compliant than ARCore, allowing objects to be shown in AR on phone easily. To add, the main gameplay loop has been discussed and fully documented.

Using ARCore, but to little success:
