Overall, initial efforts were spent on importing a previously made island based mountain and building the level upon it. Efforts made towards this involved the careful recreation of the pathing showcased in the design, making sure to give correct lengths considerate of a player's driving. After such mishaps as the inability for texturing as well as a corruption requiring the restarting of the building progress, this task was relocated into other hands that would undertake it more efficiently and thus more emphasis on creating an experience travelling back to the top of the mountain was exerted. Though initial ideas discussed with the group included easier methods such as teleportation, light investigation around the model gave rise to the idea of entering the mountain's inside from the bottom and driving back up to the top. This would give more immersion and flesh to another idea laid out with scaling up the mountain and avoiding falling rocks, helping utilise as much of the mountain's existence as possible while providing a more memorable experience.

For the overall layout, pre-existing showcases of in-mountain levels were drawn from as inspiration for helping flesh the overall idea out, with the basis being an ascension where the players' skills would be tested. Designs travelling around the rims of the mountain as well as a tower in the middle spiralling around were analysed and looked into, however a mix of both became the final layout as it would give players more of a chance to stay on as a whole, as well as allowing for a more creative design and potential obstacles like cascading rocks. 

Overall, the design generally accomodates for helping players become accustomed to the potentially intimidating driving conditions with a lengthy easier driving section before reintroducing the other mechanics over time to test them more on their skills and ability to drive in this situation. This builds up so that players are not overwhelmed instantly, having the concentration of the mechanics increase the closer to the top they get and asking a little more from the player each time before culminating into a more skill heavy segment requiring them to apply everything they've been taught into tighter drifting and vehicular control with ramps.

If the game's camera systems are functional then the next week's focus will be on the elimination system due to its high importance as a feature of the game. This will include destroying players if they're too far behind, as well as declaring the winner of each round once one person remains.
