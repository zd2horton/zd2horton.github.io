The newest paper read has been a paper called "Image Compression Using Binary Space Partitioning Trees". In this, the Binary Tree representation of images is similar to how the project's use is intended, in which lines are used to split the image at random until rooms reach a size limit. In the project, BSP will be used to split the Perlin Noise map into pieces that a user can assign levels to.
