As of now, the audio team have supplied audio for when the vending machines fall over, crush a pawn or shake. The falling and crushing audio events have been implemented without issue as they are oneshot, however the shaking audio still needs to be placed in appropriately as it is a looping clip. Due to this, a differing way will need to be found for this audio to play.
