The children are now given proper parameters via the area splitting. As well as this, a new Tree class which holds Leaves has now been created. The Tree holds a list of leaves, and creates an initial leaf to start the process of creating the overall tree. After this, it will go into a loop in which it will go through the tree's contents, and split them if required and add the children to the tree. As of now, the drawing of the tree still needs to be implemented as well as general bug fixing.
