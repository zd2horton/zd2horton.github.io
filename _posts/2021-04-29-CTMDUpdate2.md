As of current, a number of algorithms and technological methods to aid the project have been explored however most are not very applicable with the overall build of 2D platformers. Despite this, reinforcement learning, a trained artificial intelligence learning system, seems to be of good use. This involves the use of an intelligence agent that, despite not following a clear solid structure or set of instructions like other learning methods, changes states through feedback and rules provided. This is done through either model based or model free learning (basing current learning from a previous state or using a new direction) and acting upon a positive or negative reward given to base its next actions from. In context of the project at hand, this may assist with generation through creating a base level, and then using the rules and an initial plan to generate an initial level. Depending on feedback given, the algorithm would then iterate appropriately in order to perhaps create a level with more or less obstacles (possibly of one kind), around a certain ability or power up, or to modulate difficulty. This in turn could also assist with user feedback, as it would entail a more direct approach and thus general opinions and tastes could be observed through such.
