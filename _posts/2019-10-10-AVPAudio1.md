Recording audio was the focus of this session, covering such aspects as the continuous nature of analogue audio and the discrete nature of digital audio (sound files, transferred analogue audio), where digital audio is created through sampling the audio waveforms through a sampling rate.

For the more practical part of the session, we went out in groups recording various sounds throughout the campus using a TASCAM recorder. Sounds recorded in our group included footsteps, lift noises, ambience in the engineering block and umbrella noises. However, when retrieving the sounds for use on computers, sounds such as the umbrella noises seemed to be missing.

Overall however, the session proved to be very interesting and I believe the next part of the session will help us improve our work with audio editing.
