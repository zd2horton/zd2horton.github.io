I have recently been brought onto "Aromara", a Pokemon-like RPG which will also have roguelike and town building elements. I really admire the project's unique artistic style and overall scope, and have found becoming acquainted with both the project and those involved in it over the last few weeks very enjoyable so far. The codebase itself is quite large, utilising parts of an RPG pack in Unity and having a number of established systems that are being built up. I feel quite confident in being a valuable member of the team, though currently I have found areas such as the code's battle manager and turn controllers to be somewhat intimidating. Despite this, I have a lot of confidence that I'll grow in understanding with them in time, and be able to elevate the project to even greater heights. 

As of the moment, I have decided to focus on the game's capturing system as it was said to carry a number of bugs. I also found this area the most interesting during my reading of the scripts, and currently I have been able to find many bugs that I can fix rather quickly.
