We have a number of ideas for our game, some of them being a Pokemon style game in which 2 players use characters in an AR battle, a Worms like game taking place on a wall or other horizontal surface, a simple shape rotating game between players, a perspective type game and a simple pass the bomb esque game in which the phone is passed between players. This seems to be the simplest to implement and build upon from a foundation, making it the most likely to be chosen.
