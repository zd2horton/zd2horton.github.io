Documentation is continuing to be worked on, which will detail roles and the cycle of production. Research will be conducted and converted into a scripted scene, which will then be designed and implemented as a Unity scene. This will include such things as interaction with the scene and other required aspects. Postprocessing will then be undertaken, in which audio will be implented where necessary and the scene will be polished visually through effects and correct lighting. This final stage is what I have been assigned to, and most work will be on the audio implementation.
