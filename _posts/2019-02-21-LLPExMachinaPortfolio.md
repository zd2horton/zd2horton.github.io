In this top down puzzle game based on the Sci Fi hit Ex Machina, the hero Caleb must free Ava while Nathan is under his alcohol induced sleep in the scene that audiences did not see. The player must work against the clock in order to find the right keycard, open the door to Nathan's room and find his computer to win.

Escape the Movie is a grid based game in which the player moves grid by grid, collecting various items and once the right keycard has been found, access to Nathan's keypad is given but must be decrypted via a binary addition problem. The game ends once this is solved and the player reaches Nathan's computer, winning. However, each move deducts a second from the clock and a point from the score, meaning that player will lose if the time reaches 0.

The grid type movement uses a system similar to Basic Reb0rn's, in which each "grid" is assigned a number of directions that the player can go. This also builds the foundation for wall creation, as the player is not allowed to walk into them due to the direction assignment each grid has.
