The new jam theme is based on the Foundary, a building usable for various game jams throughout the year, or around the idea of the building being used for productive programming. Initially, our group had an idea which involved various programming related microgames required to be completed in quick succession, like Warioware. Some of the ideas shared were a debugging microgame in which the player would have to swipe away bugs from their code, and a robot creation microgame in which the player would have to assemble the required robot.

However, further critique has currently filtered the idea into a more minigame oriented game, at first being a collection of 3 more fleshed out microgames that could be competed in for a high score, but now being a game which envelopes the two ideas previously mentioned as well as a drone protecting minigame in a more fleshed out manner. As a result, in multiplayer sessions the game adopts a more co-operative tone in comparison to the competitive oriented focus from before.

In this idea, the player will be in the Foundary working on code and must dispel various bugs that try and ruin the code, while also trying to protect the drones and use the code to build robots. The time limit is planned to be adjustable so players can stay for as long or little as they like, and in the final quarter of the session "Crunch Time" will occur where the bugs will become higher in number, harder to shoo away and more aggressive. In terms of task allocation, I will be helping create the "debugger" side of the game.
