The current book, "Full details and actions for PyTorch Deep Learning Hands-On: Apply modern AI techniques with CNNs, RNNs, GANs, reinforcement learning, and more", contains a notable amount of further significant information on such areas as the network's data pipeline, learning rate properties and outcomes, and aspects of deep learning workflow (including planning, design, implementation, and its eventual training through the given dataset). However, with little done in terms of system implementation past a platforming framework, attention has now been shifted to such. This has currently begun with researching into the ML-Agents extension for Unity which in turn relies on reinforcement learning and PyTorch for training. In the examples given by the extension and a tutorial showing the creation of a new environment, various aspects of the agents used (such as how to collect observations and register inputs) and overall settings (including continuous/discrete actions and inference) were explained in turn making things more understandable and thus with some more exploration, a competent agent for the project should be able to be conceptualised.
