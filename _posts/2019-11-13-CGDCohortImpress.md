A rough outline has now been given of next semester's task, the cohort project. This will involve the entire module as a team in order to create a larger, higher quality game. The idea that won't be looked into was a continuation esque project from past projects using low poly racing game assets. This was used for a project named Kojima Drive last year, and the project idea was generally disfavoured against the idea that will be pushed forward. The selected idea is a top down simulation intended to educate students about safety around the campus in a comical approach, in which students will walk around the campus and fall prey to various exaggerated traps and dangers if unattended by the player and their "auras" (power-ups that can be given to students to help direct or distract others from danger). It follows a Lemmings style of gameplay as a result and could benefit from being quick, simple yet entrancing to play. 

This team has been assigned the game's events, which includes dangerous obstacles that can kill the students and overall integration with the AI. Through this task, Github project boards and wikis will be used as they can go into more detail than Trello boards. The task seems extremely interesting, and will be the closest to an industry level task so far and help give an impression of cohort work.
