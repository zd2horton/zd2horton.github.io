The event has now been coded to fit the mould of the tile system. Through this, the event uses the tiles at positions it needs to analyse and will only set the pre requisite to fall if the tile it decides to fall on is not a wall. As well as this, a different prefab has been made for a fallen machine as previously discussed, and handles the code for killing pawns.
