The new task is a selection of developing a CPU based ray tracer, a streaming open world game or an input mechanism. I have chosen to go with the open world task as it appears to be the most useful in the profession I would like to do. It will involve dynamic chunk loading and unloading as the player character moves around the world, as well as NPCs that not only load like the chunks but also have natural behaviour. The requirement for efficient data management seems very interesting, as well as the NPC aspects of the task. Pre-existing in engine methods have been heavily discouraged, so creating more unique ways of going about the task will also prove to be interesting.
