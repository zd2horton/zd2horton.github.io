Our group thought of a number of ideas, including projects that would take the idea of robotics or the movie's message literally (robotic pokemon, a platformer exploring the idea of adapting), however our final choice is a top down puzzle game in which the player escapes the room of a scene in the movie that happened offscreen.

It will be time based and have the player navigate the house setting of the movie in order to pick up items which are needed to open other areas, as well as solve an array of puzzles and interact with characters to progress. Our team has a firm idea on what the game will be, so I believe as a result that the final product will resemble the full plans very closely.
