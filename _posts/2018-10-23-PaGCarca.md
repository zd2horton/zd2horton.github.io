This session was allocated to Carcassonne, a German board game in which players attempt to score the most points using terrain tiles and four classes for character pieces: Farmer (pieces that stay on grass or "farms" for the entire game), Soldier (pieces that are placed in cities), Thief (pieces placed on roads) and Monks (placed on cloisters). Each tile is placed adjacent to an existing piece and the character pieces are, if the spaces are not taken, placed in an area in their appropriate role. Overall, our team found the game to be mostly uneeding of any improvements, the only change we incorporated involving the ability to have more than farmer near a farm (this did not heavily change the style of gameplay).
