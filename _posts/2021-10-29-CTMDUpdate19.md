During the gap setup's seventh run, rewards exponentially increased to near entirely optimal levels of 0.97 having started from almost half as much. This was likely due to the agent reaching a breakthrough, but once attempted to be built upon some subsequent runs dropped to negative levels of reward or very small amounts. It is unknown as to why this occured, with a possibility being due to overload if trying to interpret the widely varying and notably shifting rewards in the initial attempt of the eighth run's second half. Eventually, a similar reward was reached through the second attempt of the same run's efforts, though these did not reach the optimal value from before and likewise also did not fare well in runs afterwards (the subsequent ninth run having given negative one in rewards for all stages, yet mostly being responsive when the agent is given the model to control from).
