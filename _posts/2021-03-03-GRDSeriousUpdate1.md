Though the previous idea discussed of a hospital simulator based on COVID data was solid, another idea has been more fleshed out as of recent and thus will more than likely be the final idea. This entails a horse racing esque simulation mirroring a political race, with each horse representing a political party. The speed of each horse would be determined on the current election data, potentially with electoral college votes affecting the speeds also while players could bet on the horse they think can win. As an overall visualisation project this could be utilised by a larger range of users due to its lesser focus on being a game, and may also prove useful for a longer period of time than the demonstration for COVID figures. Though it would not have as much interaction as this idea, the political horse race would also require far less concentration due to this, and would thus be more accessible as a result on top of this. From here, implementation of an API pulling political data will be looked into and reported on.
