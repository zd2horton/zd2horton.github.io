In this next assignment, we are to research one of three given topics and write an analytical essay. A period of time was given to look at the three topics, research into them and see which is our preference. The first topic looks into possible definitions of "games" and see if they are able to include videogames while also building our own definition. The second topic explores motivation and how companies motivate players to play their game long after release (perhaps through using different motivational factors and techniques in the design), as well as how doing as such can be concerning ethically and socially. The third and final topic looks into diversity in the industry, looking at ethical responsibilities and implications as well as gender equality. 

From the three topics given, I will write about motivation as it seems to approach writing from a more psychological view, which interests me and allows me to be more analytical concerning points than if I were to choose either of the other choices. The topic may also stem into the first and "why we play", taking inspiration from normal play as well as videogames. Medical journals may also be useful here, discussing the problem of addiction and more implications of a person's motivation.
