In the session today, a number of possible Audio Visual skills were evaluated in terms of our ability to use them. From the many listed, there were a number that I have not yet acquired experience in which included motion capture (the recording of movement using markers), audio recording, masking (usage of "masks" to modify or protect an area of the video) and matting (the combination of a foreground focus with a different backgroun focus). As well as this, while I have filmed before, it was at a very novice level and quite some time ago.

As well as this, I have incredibly basic skills in video compositing (combining various images and video into a single belivable scene, similar to chroma key), colour grading (improving an image using various colour tools), VFX and particle effects as well as slightly more experience in 3D modelling and animation, yet I will need to improve these skills drastically. However, I have had mostly intermediate experience with video editing and chroma key (manipulation of a source through a removable background colour). 

I would argue that overall, I will need to improve in every skill listed in order to fully succeed at delivering a quality project, especially with those I have experience with yet am not good at such as 3D modelling. This aspect in particular will need to improve so that I will be able to contribute to mock-ups for use in both planning and my log.


The session also had us evaluate the effectiveness of the Google Cardboard headsets. The headset was good for a quick VR experience, however it required holding up and was also decently confusing to set up and also required a smartphone inside of it. As a result, it wasn't incredibly immersive and as a result of not using a higher end set up the visuals seemed notably pixelated which harmed the immersion, as well as the audio output requiring the use of the phone's native speakers.

Due to the lack of an immersive atmosphere, I did not feel any kind of emotional reaction using the headset which could also be a result of the videos watched using it. As an improvement, I would try adding a headband so that the user would not need to hold the headset using their hands, however otherwise as a basic smartphone oriented headset it is fine.

In the personality test that was assigned to us, I was given a Virtuoso (ISTP-A/ISTP-T) personality which is described as a curious and imaginative personality which learns through trial and error. I feel like these points apply well to me, as I especially like learning through trial and error, as well as the personality being described furthermore as a more private one. On the other hand, they are also described as "calm but suddenly spontaneous, extremely curious but unable to stay focused on formal studies" which unfortunately can describe myself at various points also as that aspect of myself is something I need to improve.
