This year, we have been assigned a "Creative Technology Project", which is a research project which allows us to explore and analyse a topic of our interest. Due to my interest in level design in video games, I developed a proposal over the Summer concerning procedural level design, which involves generating a level using algorithms.

So far I have explored various examples of procedural level design in such games as Minecraft and Spelunky, the latter of which seems to be close to what I wish to accomplish as it creates a level path from start to end, then filling the rest of the area with various other rooms before decorating the layout with items and altering a number of the layouts placed.

A way that I would be able to differentiate myself from the method that Spelunky uses could be through usage of noise generation and linear interpolation, Perlin Noise being an example. As these topics are especially new to me, I will need to spend a considerable amount of time researching and coming to understand them.    
  
As a result of the many possibilities procedural level generation can provide to the player as well as possibly reducing the amount of work required overall for level design for developers, procedural level design can be a very useful tool. In summary, I would like to create a system that uses procedural generation to create levels, picking level pieces accordingly and altering them accordingly in order to fully build a game level which I believe I will be able to do with enough dedication. 


A summarisation of Spelunky's method of procedural level generation:
