This session required the composition, sequence and editing of many audio pieces recorded from last session into a believable situation in a film or game. As well as this, various audio editing methods were explained including cutting and fading audio in and out to make a sound more natural.

My final product involved the meshing of the various sound effects recorded last week to create a sequence where a person walks up a flight of stairs, opens a sensored door and takes a lift down to a lower level to end up in a crowded room. I found meshing the sounds together to be very entertaining, unique and imaginative overall and while I knew most of the techniques that were covered in the session, I hope to learn more in the coming weeks.

The audio can be listened to through clicking the video below:
