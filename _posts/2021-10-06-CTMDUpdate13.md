As of now, the report has been fleshed out some more with more subheadings and a small amount of research material for the level design research subheading (such as "An Architectural Approach to Level Design" by W.C. Totten). Alongside this, supervisor discussion has encouraged the continued method of having the agent learn from increments, with a specific suggestion of having a jumping challenge via a structure ("straining" the environment so it requires learning around the structure) instead of a gap, requiring it jump over but allowing it to try again if failed as to assist with learning. This also leads into potentially finding an alternate route without jumping, giving a quicker method for it. This will be taken into consideration with the next steps, in which agent jumping will be looked at more closely.
