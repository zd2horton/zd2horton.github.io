<center><b>ASGE</b> is a minimal game engine in C++ based on XNA ideas.</center>
     
#### Awesome Sauce Game Engine
Developed in response to students needs, a small framework built upon modern C++ was created modelled in the XNA mould. It is designed to afford accessible game development, but restrict the level of hand-holding required. At current, it supports only 2D and does not provide advanced technologies such as networking or controller input.
