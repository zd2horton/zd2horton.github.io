Foundations for the Vending Machine event have been implemented. As of the moment, the distance between a Pawn and the machine itself is calculated and compared to see if the pawn is close enough to the detection radius. If it is, a random chance of the machine falling is calculated and if higher than the given fall chance, the machine will be set up to fall. As well as this method, it will also be set up to fall if a pawn interacts with it in which it is detected if the pawn is facing it or not. For the moment, a physical representation of the machine will be put on hold until at least the roots for the code have been fully put in place.
