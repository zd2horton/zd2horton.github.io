Both an energy bar for gameplay, and a menu scene have been implemented. The menu scene involves a simple implementation using buttons which call different functions when called (currently starting gameplay and exiting the application have been implemented, the former using LoadScene). Animations have also been included to give juice to the menu buttons, which are done once the mouse waves over them as well as exiting. In a similar likeness, the energy bar utilises the Slider aspect in order to appropriately move the bar image in relation to the player energy.
