As of now, audio for the town trading scene has been acquired and is being currently implemented. Audio for the sand terrain on which the wagon will travel on has been fully placed inside, and other audio such as livestock and working audio is currently being tweaked to sound appropriate for the spaces they have been assigned to. From this I have found out that the volumetric radius is more important than the range on having a sense of auditory distance, and will use this knowledge to improve the auditory experience as a whole.
