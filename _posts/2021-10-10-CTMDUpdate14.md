Currently, a similar outcome to the previous attempts is taking place with the jumping structure, with the agent not having much decision in its direction initially before eventually being able to somewhat control itself in direction of the target. Though showing promise, the created network does not always reach the coin and was also created with default hyperparameters, and thus finding a more optimal set of custom hyperparameters and potentially ML system in of itself is of highest priority.
