All audio for the trading scene has been fully implemented. When the player starts the scene, they will be able to hear livestock and chattering in the distance, which will grow closer as they venture on. Anvil work will be audible once they get into the main square, and will fade out alongside the other audio once the player has left the plaza. Implementation currently seems to have only one issue at the moment, in which the sand's audio for the wagon cuts off at the end of its loop thus making things sound less fitting. This will be looked into and fixed once the problem has been identified. As well as this, audio for the bandit scene has been edited for use, such as harsh wind, snow audio for the wagon, and burning audio for crashed wagons near the bandits themselves. Appropriate audio for the player wagon crashing still needs to be found, but shouldn't be hard to locate.
