After an amount of initial toggling around, the player's RigidBody gravity scale proved to be an effective downwards acceleration when increased. This was further helped by the increasing of the scale per frame while above the ground (resetting once on ground), making for a better defined jump arc. Alongside this, the overall run speed was dropped to 1.5 times the walk speed, with the walk speed itself and max jump velocity increasing as to improve overall handling. As of now, a jump height modifier scaling with button hold time is the last aspect required and has a current implementation in which velocity is increased per frame of the button being held, but now seems to keep the player very close to the ground regardless of hold time. Once this issue has been resolved, the player should have a more refined jump system and other aspects will be open for improvement or development.
