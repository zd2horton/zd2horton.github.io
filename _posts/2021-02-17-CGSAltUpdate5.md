As of the moment, the code has been looked into more and in terms of its writing is mostly understandable, but may take some time in order for it to be fully understandable for the context for which it is needed. There are some similar aspects to Unity however, such as a RigidBody class with kinematic and gravity settings. A ball class is being looked into for implementation, which should carry such information as the assigned player, its current state and its co-ordinates in the world space. 

For the next workstream, the general IP has been decided out of the selection that was made available. The first was a game in beta named Speed Titans, an icebreaking game in which a team have 3 rounds to build a machine in a scrapheap esque situation which will be travel down the asphalt after a certain amount of time in each round is up. The game's intention is for each consecutive round to build on the last in terms of quality of the machines as the groups will slowly begin to kindle, providing for a very co-operative experience. However, a dragracing element was implemented and is not currently engaging due to being a series of quick-time events, so the task for this task would have been to make it an entertaining feature.

The third game which seems to be past the beta phase, Autarky, is a game about communism and managerial ineffectiveness, where everything is broken but things are made to look functional on the surface as a sort of act to provide a fake world. The gameplay echoes this through a Papers Please and Tycoon hybrid in which a van is built with full support of the people, before a cycle of more vans and less support/money perpetuates until there are a large number of vans being made as there is no money or support, with the collapse of the state imminent. As a general production management and tycoon esque affair, the aim is to defy as much of the resource collapse as possible.

The final but second game, Apex Run, is generally planned out but does not have very much implemented. Its low poly look paves way for the intention of a racing party game with similar combo mechanics to 80s beat-em-ups, with damage and potential systems identified as well as the development of car classes. This option was generally decided on by the group as its less developed state allows for a more open ended approach on its development, an aspect that the other choices lack due to their more specific workstream in this context. As well as this, the general aesthetic of the project proved to be more appealing to the group members alongside the genre the game falls into, allowing the possibility of more zany ideas compared to the other projects. Implementations surrounding the game will be discussed among the group very soon.
