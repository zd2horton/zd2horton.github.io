Progress is being made a lot faster, the game now having a fully readily prepared inventory system, and a functioning menu with options. There is basic code that moves the player implemented, however there is also code that will detect using the room array mentioned previously whether the player can move to another grid on the map or not depending on the direction specified. This should not take long to implement along with other elements which should be brought altogether easily to create the final game without too many problems.
