The game is now fully developed, and has been shown off in a demo type setting. As implemented, it follows a multitude of intuitive touch based minigames on one screen that either one player or multiplayer players working together can tackle in order to upkeep their work in the Foundary, giving a small, cartoon-like and accessible insight into what the Foundary is and what it is used for. In terms of improvement for the overall project, it is a lot more polished than the last and each part combines to create a game which can be played in various ways. Furthermore, communication has also been significantly improved as a Trello board has been used to keep track of separate tasks in the project, and Slack has been used more for clarification. This was also further aided by a more unified codebase and better teamwork overall.

While the project was fairly successful, slightly tighter communication may have helped push it further, as well as potentially ironing out any problems earlier than they were addressed. More quality of life aspects could have also benefitted the game, such as a visible timer and highscores (to encourage multiple plays). Planned features,such as "Crunch" (in which the final quarter of the game would increase in difficulty for each game, such as spawning more resistant bugs in high numbers) and stress (in which if players did not press a coffee button to "drink" and lower stress, they would experience a burnout), could have further increased diversity for the game and help give the game a more enjoyable flow.
