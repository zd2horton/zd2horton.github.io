In our first session of Gameplay Programming, we were tasked to research into the role of a gameplay programmer and what is expected of them should they apply for a job as well as other aspects. Many of the positions wished for high end C++ skills and teamwork as expected, however a large number of the positions also wanted passionate, ambitious and friendly individuals. 

The most interesting of these is Naughty Dog, who in their video stated that rather than "credentials, background" and perhaps even "10 years of experience or lifelong console experience", their applicants must be driven by passion.  Overall, this task was extremely interesting for me to research into with others and also made me realise that aspects other than pure programming skill will aid me in the future when looking for a game programming job.
