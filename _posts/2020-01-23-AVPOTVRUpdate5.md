As of now, a full scenario has been implemented and is ready for post-processing on my end. However, while research on the Oregon Trail was conducted on my end in order to help scenario writing, it has been misplaced and thus must be rewritten. This should not take too long and afterwards post-processing can be concentrated on again.
