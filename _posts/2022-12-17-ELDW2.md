World 2 has been finished, with it being a world requiring more thought from the player in terms of both the levels themselves and the overall combat. The levels it houses are a lot more purposeful in their design, centering on specific areas the world wants to teach the player while also being unique levels in their own right. Most levels kept notable aspects from their conception, except for 2-1 which originally was intended to have a "roulette block" which would cycle through powerups until the player hit it, after which the powerup would be decided. This was attempted through LUA, but unfortunately was unable to be implemented due to difficulties.
