I found the booth viva to be very enjoyable, especially through playing other's games and giving feedback and possible improvements. The main criticism of our game was that the game did not talk with the player enough or explain how to play, which caused confusion and stilted enjoyment. This was mainly brought up with the binary minigame, which upon reflection does not prompt the user on how to complete it. 

Implementing a user interface or similar in order to guide the player through the game was not brought up consistently in development, which due to the importance of it to the user's integral experience is incredibly problematic and in future projects, will be one of the first aspects I will address.
