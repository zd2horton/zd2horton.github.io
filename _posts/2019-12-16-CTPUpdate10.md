For now, it seems that Perlin Noise has been fully implemented. Maps are fully generated upon request, and colour assignment is also functional after various incorrect variable calls (namely, the accidental use of the display height when the display width was the correct to use) in the Texture Generator were fixed. As well as this, it also seemed that another problem were the incorrect placement of loop letters used in equations inside nested loops. Going through the code line by line and double checking each loop eventually fixed the error, and allowed the colour maps to generate as intended.

With this, the research report has also been finished and submitted. Overall, I was not able to find a large amount of academic papers that would aid with the practical project itself, but as a whole researching into both Perlin Noise and Binary Space Partitioning has helped grasp a better understanding of what they are and how they can be used.
