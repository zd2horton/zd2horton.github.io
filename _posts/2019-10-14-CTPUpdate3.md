The project is now finalised as including Perlin Noise and BSP in order to generate roguelike dungeons. With this, the intention is to use Perlin Noise to generate a map which can then have parts of it selected by a menu and have dungeon rooms generated and saved if preferred. As well as this, I read into a paper named "Level Design Patterns in 2D Games". This paper details many attributes about a standard 2D level, including such things as guides that the levels use to aim the player to where they need to go, and branching pathways. While the outline of the project may not require details like these, it could help make it unique and also in a practical situation give more of a cohesive and believeable experience for a player.
