In this week's sessions, fuller details of the marking and general expectations of the module were specified, however a Research and Development task has also been given. Currently prioritising research and evaluation, there will be three weeks to create an interactive rain system which can be dropped in for developers to use. From here, a Game Design Document and Technical Design Document are being worked on documenting the overall approach that will be taken as well as interactions for each potential object and effect.

The system is planned to be an easily implementable and usable feature for any developer, with an array of customisation options to be of assistance. As well as this, the rainfall itself will be managed through a particle system, including the creation of clouds. Overall, the UI should be able to handle such aspects as rain intensity as well as the rain's colour and shape, also including considerations for lower end machines, such as the toggling of splashes and simpler rain particles.

As for interactions, the behaviour of rain in many circumstances including in videogames and in real life has been followed intensely and consequently an interaction grid and flowchart for most possible scenarios have been made. These will also prove useful for when interactions will need to be implemented in order of priority, as some interactions will clearly be more important for the overall product than others.
