As of the last two weeks, a strange bug has been occuring in which the areas drawn are extremely small and close to the corners of the map. It seems to be a scaling issue at first but it also seems to be affected by co-ordinates, as even increasing the size of the areas would not change where they are situated. As of the moment, I would believe it to be a mix of scaling and missing areas, so the best thing for now would be to set about reintroducing the previously removed areas.
