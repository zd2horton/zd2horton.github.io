Overall, I found working in a capable group to be refreshing. Our team was able to be mostly stable in our work and each of us were assigned a document to direct (with which others could assist); I was assigned the Technical Design Document. The project helped me better my teamwork skills as well as my presentation skills, both being incredibly necessary life skills.
