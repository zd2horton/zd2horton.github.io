In my opinion, I see this module as the strangest of the four. It is a lot more technical than the rest including the assignment itself, as game engines have more complex workings than the games that are being created on them. The assignment is a system that will help developers implement a feature of choice easier, as well as provide sliders for perimeters surrounding it. I have chosen rain, as it allows for a lot of features such as clouds, shininess of puddles and splash. Overall, when compared with Game Level Design, I am unsure if this module will be something I excel at or not.
