Due to having taken both a GCSE and A Level in Business Studies, I found the prospect of a law case study extremely interesting, especially factoring in the effects the researched topic would have on the industry overall. As a result I chose a legal case which ensued between Sony, Microsoft and Immersion, a creator of haptic technology who filed a lawsuit against both companies for supposed patent infringing due to vibration features found in the PlayStation and XBox controllers. Investigating the lawsuit was very compelling to me, and giving a rounded debate on the subject helped further my analytical skills even further than before making this task one of my favourites.
