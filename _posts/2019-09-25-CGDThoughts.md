Commercial Games Development will involve a multitude of various projects in which we are expected to work in teams in order to create a final game. This module looks to be very interesting and I hope to imprrove my teammworking skills as I progress. 

The current project is to create an 8 bit-esque demake of a pre-existing video game, which will be Untitled Goose Game as chosen by my current group. The game requires the player to fulfil objectives as a goose by creating as much carnage for the NPCs as possible in varied ways, making for a very novel experience. 

As our group will be demaking the game as if it were developed for the Atari 2600, a lot of the mechanics such as honking, item pickups and abilities will need to be condensed. We have decided that a tutorial level with 2 levels afterwards is the best approach, with honking being the pivotal focus of the game's progress as items would need to be simplified. As well as this, NPCs would behave in a more simple manner through chasing, taking items from the player and becoming startled from the honks as well as the colour palette of the game's sprites sharing Atari 2600's. Overall, I believe that the end result will be an interesting and enjoyable simplification of the original game.
