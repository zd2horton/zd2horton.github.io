As a whole, the temple's solitary tile is developing as planned with a collection of mountainous terrain building up into the middle. After some initial balancing of the temple's hill and hill creation around the temple as well as some decoration however, it has been found that the hills may be too steep for those with middling power to climb, which is not optimal due to the tile's nature as an early feature. Thus, alongside initial work on the other tiles, this tile will be balanced so that players with less energy will be able to reach the temple without a large amount of issue, and will introduce them to rover charging in a more friendly matter if they are unable to ascend at first.
