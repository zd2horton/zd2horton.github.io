As of now, work is generally continuing as expected, in which work on scripting and designing the next scenarios is taking place, and post-processing for the first is under way. Currently, ambiance as well as fire crackling and wagon travelling have been acquired and are being edited for use in the scene. Requirements such as lighting and other ambient sounds are being listed, and will be implemented in order to give polish to the scenario.
