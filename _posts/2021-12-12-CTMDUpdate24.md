In a later segment of the first level, the agent is seemingly dwardling in some areas as if trying to hone in on a reward that is not present. As advised by a recent meeting, more emphasis is being placed on the time penalty as to get the agent to be more active, potentially via removing the positive side as to avoid neutralisation of both positive and negative forces.

Additionally, the report is to be altered to be structured more effectively and not bury or seed relevant information all across different paragraphs. This should help with the flow of the paper, and lessen confusion about any potentially complex manners explained inside. This is especially relevant with the AI Agent implementation segment, which has now been segmented into relevant subsections such as the states, rewards and actions of the setup as well as the overall learning process.
