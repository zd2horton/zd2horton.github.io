The dissertation has been detailed, being a self motivated and directed piece in creating a practical prototype of a creative technologies system. As it will be a practical prototype, it may also prove to be valuable or even expandable at a future time afterwards, becoming a valuable asset to a portfolio. Qualitative and quantitative research will be undertaken in an area of interest, identifying general requirements as well as research related aspects around the same time before then designing and creating a system to meet the aforementioned requirements. Its utility will then be evaluated before it is developed further and all aspects of this process are evaluated in turn. 

For the 2000 word proposal required for May, the problem being addressed will be identified and outlined alongside relevant context, with the proposed approach of meeting the project requirements as well as time management. The topic from here should be formulated into a research question or hypothesis for looking into. Also similar to the previous year's dissertation will be a supervisor available for guiding through and identifying relevant material in the research area, while also helping with refining the project's aims and scope alongside the planning. A significant aim will be to attempt to seek assistance and feedback from the supervisor more with this dissertation, as a lot of time was spent trying to attempt the task alone only to meet various difficulties. Remedying this will hopefully cause the process to become easier, as the task will not be tackled largely alone. This should also include initiating contact with them regularly and planning out a timetable for both contact and progress milestones, as well as receiving feedback on draft pieces.

While a supervisor will be consulted with on a more notable basis this time, a solid hold on the work shall still be taken with constant logs recording progress and documents concerning the dissertation and a large amount of time dedicated to both research and practical elements. The final 12000 word academic report will incorporate all of the implementations and findings discovered, due in mid November.
