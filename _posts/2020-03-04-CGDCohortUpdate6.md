Overall, though not much has happened this week ideas about further implementation are being discussed. In terms of the fallen vending machine, a different prefab entirely is being considered over a "fallen" state for one prefab. This would make it easier to switch between its states through the given tile system that the machine will need to obey, with the tile system being another thing that will need to be figured out in order to continue in the long term.
