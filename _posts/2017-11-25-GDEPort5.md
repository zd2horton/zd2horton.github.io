Due to having considerable prior knowledge about emulation beforehand, this assignment was very enjoyable for me to write and ultimately became my favourite of the portfolio tasks. Throughout, I was able to think of what to discuss next in the essay and I also learned a lot more about emulation, porting and examples of piracy as I progressed through my research.
