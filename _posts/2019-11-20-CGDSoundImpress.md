The new Game Jam is to do with sound and the theme of "Faster Than....". In this, FMOD Studio integration with FMOD events is required, which as a result means that Music Tech teams (featuring a composer, and creative and technical sound designers) will be assisting with audio. Initially, ideas of a game in which the player runs from a sound based threat were discussed, but further ideas eventually transformed the concept into a game in which the player must capture alien creatures in a sci-fi like ship or setting. Sound can be used extensively in this context to creative an immersive atmosphere that reacts to any action, including noise created by the aliens to help the player. In this, I will be assisting with areas that add "juice", including the player's animations and models, menus and recieving feedback through others playtesting. As a large volume of polish and varied amount of playtesting were not implemented in the first two Jams, doing so this time could help improve the final game significantly.
