Currently, a minimap has been implemented which is able to depict the player and some structures in the environment. As well as this, assets for a potential scanner have been imported, and basic axis based movement using torque force has been added. Progress has also begun on an energy system for the Rover, which will entail the diminishing of either the Rover's stamina or vision.
