Currently, talks about a newly implemented system to design tracks have been had, and how the level design has changed as a result. This new system encourages smaller, more compact courses that loop around in order to eliminate players over the more traditional racing track down a mountain that was initially created. Many believed that the latter and its ability to ease players in was more important in terms of track design, and that the former could potentially stagnate more due to being noticably shorter. However, those supporting the former reaffirmed that they would be more useful for an elimination style game such as Apex Drive, and that having elements of a tutorial even if not explicitly made prevalent could go against the idea of "quick, snappy rounds". As well as this, emphasis was placed on the debate of Apex Drive being a "racing game", with the final conclusion being more towards an elimination party game in which vehicles are controlled and hence giving the concept of shorter, snappier tracks more leverage and weight. This was further supported by the idea of progressive difficulty potentially holding back the overall flow of the track design. In all, this debate assisted with unifying views of the team members on the project, as many had different ideas of what the project was and what values it would hold.
