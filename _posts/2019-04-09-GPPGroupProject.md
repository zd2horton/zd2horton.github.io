In our group project, there are three different levels. Level 1 is an introductory level in which the player collects coins jumping from moving platforms and hills, as well as discovering the speed boost and double jump power ups. Both are introduced in ways that require them, as the speed boost is needed to run through a timed opening, and the double jump is needed to jump on high ledges. The level ends with two small slimes for the player to slay so they can adjust to combat.

Level 2 opens with pressing a switch, and uses a spline to climb up a spiral to a large platform that lifts the player up to the bulk of the level. Slimes are also scattered around the level to further comfort the player into combat. From here they are given the double jump power up to jump across large gaps made by platforms spread apart, also requiring the double jump powerup to conquer due to their speedy nature. Another singular platform then brings the player to a hall of sweeping walls, which after dodging and passing each leads to an elevator for the final level.

The final level begins with a button that must be pressed, opening the door far away from the player. The player must then travel down a series of platforms to reach the door in time before it shuts again, forcing them to try over. Following this, the door leads to two large slimes which must be taken down in order to progress. Once the slimes are defeated, the final area of the level is a Simon Says esque puzzle in which the player is able to see three lights flick to different colours. There is also an array of platforms in front of them which don the same colours, requiring the player to stand on them in the order the lights gave. Doing so unlocks the door in front of the puzzle and wins the game for the player.
