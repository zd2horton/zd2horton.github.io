Last week, we began to plan which aspects of the game would be handled by members of the team. I will be programming the card system of the game, including the cards themselves with their statistics, and the various mechanics that are required for their play such as shuffling player decks, picking up cards and disposing of them. 

Currently, I have created a .dat file with a json style formatting for reading in the program and will build on this if more efficient methods are found, but for next week I will attempt to create a system that can read the file in and extract the data.

The current .dat file hosting the data of each card:
