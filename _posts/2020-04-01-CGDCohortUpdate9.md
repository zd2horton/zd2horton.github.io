Generally, the vending machine implementation is mostly complete and is just now being fixed here and there, such as if it does not fall at certain points, kill pawns or if machines keep cloning. As well as this, the base machine is now destroyed when the falling begins, which in itself is now more consistent. From here, we will need to implement a front falling sprite for the machine, as none exist yet.
