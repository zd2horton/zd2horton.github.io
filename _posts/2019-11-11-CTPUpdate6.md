This week, two papers were read into which dived into Perlin Noise. "Perlin noise in Real-time Computer Graphics" generally went into the detailed background of the feature, however I did not see much that would be of practical use to the project. This was a similar case for "A Survey of Procedural Noise Functions", but provided more uses for the Noise that I did not know previously, such as the mention of splined interpolation through calculated random gradients on a cubic lattice's vertices. While again this may not be useful for the application of the actual project itself, it makes for better understanding of Perlin Noise as a whole.
