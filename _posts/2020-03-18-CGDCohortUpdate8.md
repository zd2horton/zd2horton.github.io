Though not much has been done in ways of code, visual effects for when the machine shakes are being discussed. The best method would be clearly seen even in a zoomed out situation for players to clearly see, and thus bars to signify the intensity of the shake (e.g: 1 to 3 bars) would be appropriate. To add, a way to implement this is also being looked for that would also work in the tile implementation.
