Carrying on from the previous week's aspirations, a tutorial esque level has been created. The general design of the course adopted an approach that lets the player become accustomed to the game and vehicle's mechanics themselves rather than being told by the game itself or an NPC. This in turn will result in far more natural learning, and help players feel more accomplished for teaching themselves. Writing down each aspect required for teaching managed to make the design process far simpler, as they were able to be ordered and thus structured the level sensibly for a solid learning curve. As such, the beginning segment allows for the player to get a feel for the vehicle's acceleration before introducing steering, slowly allowing them to learn before the next aspect of the game is taught. This process continues on, giving small subtle foreshadowing to the features beforehand and giving players space and time to learn them while they're being focused on. Once the end has been reached, the overall mechanics have been showcased and leave the player to expand upon the learning they received in the time playing the track. Light adjustments or possibly even a second track in of itself could be made, but as of the moment implementation into Unity will be top priority.
