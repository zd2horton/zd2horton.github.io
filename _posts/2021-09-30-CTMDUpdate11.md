Currently, hyperparameters in the configuration file have been altered to fit a more spacious area than the default given in the official documentation for PPO continuous agents. This has initially resulted in an extremely indecisive agent that fluctuates between directions, sparingly jumps and is not able to jump to reach the coin due to such. Other results done through alterations to areas (such as total steps, batch size, decision periods, buffer size and even changing to discrete actions) have not changed much in way of a successful outcome, with similar being applicable for an attempt to add or deduct rewards based on distance away from the coin. These other results, though holding potential including runs that have had the agent jump continuously or move to the right while jumping, have usually given not much to develop and thus more must be done to find a beneficial outcome.
