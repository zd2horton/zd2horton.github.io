The findings with the game have been presented appropriately, resulting in some more potential pointers being given. Such quality of life pieces such as a special camera shown on a big screen for players to watch would help give more of an experience, while overall general presentation would help the player become more immersed. This in turn means that more emphasis and a bigger picture should be placed on it in order to help the project, while more simplistic elements should be implemented first (simple golf interactions, collisions, scores etc.) over more complex features (a scoreboard). Though potentially more simplistic in nature for a VR based world, AltSpaceVR has been regarded as notable for the mutual trust users have with each other; as a result possibly giving way for more player interaction and assistance with each other if required in multiplayer sessions. Other recommendations such as keeping with what has already been proven, creating a list of restrictions and breeding creativity from it may also help, though less with final implementation but rather planning and potentially programming if required at points. Meanwhile, other implementation based ideas included the popping of a player's basketball if not shot in and thus recording shots via used basketballs, as well as a screen for each player holding basketballs for them. These suggestions lean towards a more unique, basketball-esque loop that could stand out if implemented properly. A possible disadvantage of this implementation however would be that players may have to travel to the initial screen after losing their current ball in order to pick a new one, in turn leading to a monotonous set of journies that would lower enjoyment and investment. As for now, gameplay related aspects such as scoring, winning conditions and interactions between the balls and the players will be written up for.
