The first tile of Dusk Forest has been created, specifically designed for familiarising the player with the game's overall controls and potential layouts while also emphasising free roaming. This includes an initial introduction to movement and momentum via the hill the player begins on, a subtle tutorial which intends the player teach themselves aimed movement with the Rover, beginning level bumpy and hilled areas which can accustom them to later landscapes as well as provide for objective locations, and a temple area for objectives. However, in order to create more of a free space and not overwhelm the player as well as fitting with the levels of content per tile found in other current tiles, there is consideration on shifting the tile so that more emphasis is placed on the tile's kelp field while the adjacent tile focuses more on the temple. This would be optimal as it would not present the player with too many notable areas at once, and will increase the feeling of accomplishment upon exploring.
