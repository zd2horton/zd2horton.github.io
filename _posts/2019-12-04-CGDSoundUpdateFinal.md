During the demo today, constructive critique was given on the project. While the capturing animation was highlighted as a clear improvement, application of audio was a far more notable area of improvement. Sounds for walking were implemented, however the main focus of the game which is to find the creatures using the audio cues they give off has not been realised yet due to the implementation of the aforementioned sounds still needing to take place. The situation has been attributed to the lack of understanding of FMOD Studio, which has seemed to be the case with multiple other groups with their games. This issue will be able to be fixed in the future once a high understanding of FMOD Studio has been attained, alongside the other improvements suggested as such more indication of a capture (for example, an extra visual cue) as well as a difficulty curve in order to keep the game from stagnating. Overall however, this project seems to be the most solid so far in terms of both gameplay and juice, using such aids as a dynamic menu and various particle effects.
