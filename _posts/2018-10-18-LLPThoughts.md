This module, at least for the moment, seems to be a continuation of last year's Entertainment Software Development. I am finding the current assignment, a porting of a book adventure game from BASIC to C++ very interesting to plan out and also think the later tie in with Play and Games is also very promising, as I will be able to learn how to create a networked game. I will be posting updates on the latter as I make progress.
