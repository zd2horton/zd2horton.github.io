Work continues on the Cohort Jam today, with the aspect of the game assigned being events. As such, various ideas for events in the game have been brainstormed, such as level specific events (e.g: Wind Tunnel) and fire events. Having discussed each possible event, each have been ordered in terms of priority for implementation. A more formal version of this list and more are to be expected in the events segment for the GDD to be written for next week.
