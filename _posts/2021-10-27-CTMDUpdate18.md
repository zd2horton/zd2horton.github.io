With the agent confident in staircase esque setups, singular gaps were then introduced. This was wildly unsuccessful at first due to the gap's slightly earlier positioning, but has learned from this point onwards with model insertion being mostly successful. This learning has been somewhat slow compared to other setups however, in turn potentially forecasting a time costly learning schedule for the level aspect.
