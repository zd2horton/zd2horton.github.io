The final task of Introduction to Artificial Intelligence was very strange and complex to me. I chose kNN (Nearest Neighbour) as the algorithm to implement, however I did not initially know how to implement it in code. This is the only task in the first year of my studies that I am extremely dissatisfied with, and if I were to be assigned it again I would be required to read extremely heavily around the matter, as even with the reading I partook in to attempt this assignment I was still left confused.
