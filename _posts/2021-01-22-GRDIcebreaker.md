To start, two sessions were held on Tuesday and Friday, with the former being an overview of what to expect for the year as well as an introductory session for the group. As for what was explained, the upcoming modules were summarised with clarity and as a whole despite the absurd conditions of this year I hope to excel in each module to the best of my ability. 

On Friday, an application called AltSpaceVR was explored by the group. This further helped everyone to establish themselves with others, and also gave an insight on various user created projects as well as creation tools themselves.
