The general aim for the task was to create a demade version of a popular game similar to an Atari 2600 game. Overall, I would believe that the aesthetic used for the final project fits this relatively well (through using the NTSC Atari colour palette and similarly drawn sprites), as well as bringing core gameplay mechanics over and rejecting mechanics that were not required for a functional game.
Despite this, improvements could have made in a few areas. Some items could have been drawn to better represent items of the era, and the honk sound effect used for the goose could have been reduced in quality to make it before believable (as the initial sound is just a normal goose honk). The camera used could be changed to a static esque camera also, as the one implemented was a follow camera which for the time was not used often if not at all.

As well as this, the game would have also benefitted from being fleshed out more. The level given follows a learning curve where the beginning area gives the player an item to open the rest of the map with before introducing NPC and their behaviours, before letting the player roam free and use their knowledge to clear the map. This makes for a good tutorial level and those who played the game enjoyed the open ended aspect, however further levels as were planned in the initial ideas would have given the game more replayability and value through more world interaction and player flow.

As stated in a previous post, the largest issue presented was team communication and organisation. This was especially apparent with trying to figure out what each person was assigned in comparison to others, and trying to co-ordinate those tasks with other parts of the project. Clarity became another issue as a result of this, which could also delay tasks or require others to fulfil them.
In terms of organisation, there were a handful of folders and files in the project that served the same purpose and proved to segment the project, causing further confusion. Differing coding styles did not help this, as it also added to overall confusion and would cause code style clashes.

In order to improve overall, the team next time would benefit from a lot more communication and usage of communication channels in order to discuss the project and help one another with tasks. This in turn would improve clarity, as tasks would able to be outlined and regulated clearly, with a more unified code base also helping the overall project.
