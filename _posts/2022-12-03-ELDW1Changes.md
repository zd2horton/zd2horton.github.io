Overall, a decent handful of changes were made to the world's levels though helped significantly improve their quality and approachability for any player. These are detailed more in the video below, and World 2 will have a similar structure though there are less improvements required for it. Alongside this, a large amount of 3-1 has been created, and will receive its own dedicated post once finished.
