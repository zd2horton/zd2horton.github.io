In this week's supervisor session, I formed more of an idea of what I would like the end result of my project to be. On top of procedurally generating levels for a roguelike game, I have decided that I would also like to implement a UI system that could at will place and delete items from rooms at the developer's wish, and save the desired finished product to an external file. This idea was inspired from discussing projects with another in the session, making the sessions overall very useful in helping me fully flesh out my idea.
