The current task will be a choice of two that incorporate deep learning, and one without for those who are using deep learning in their Creative Technologies Project. The first of the tasks involves a tool that uses deep learning in order to create a game asset from source data, Python and Tensorflow while the second involves deep learning and Python to create a system that takes an image from a user and creates a game related to it in Unity (for instance, a racing game woudl be generated from a picture of a car). 

Due to my Creative Technologies Project not incorporating deep learning, I will be required to choose from these two and I believe the former is a better choice as an example given pertained to level generation using map imagery. This fits closer with what I would like to do, and would once again help in providing me with more experience in the field of level design as well as deep learning. As for Python, the language that will be used, I have had prior experience with it dating back to AS and A Levels, and I think I am comfortable with using it as the language to create the required system.
