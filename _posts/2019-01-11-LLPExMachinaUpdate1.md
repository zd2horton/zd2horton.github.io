At the current moment, maps have been drawn for potential levels that can be implemented into the game alongside notes on the game's possible mechanics and implementations. I myself have created a prototype featuring a potential layout for a level and a basic UI, in which the player would need to reach Nathan's keycard to save Ava after solving various puzzles. The final game should incorporate levels more diverse and complex than this in order to explore its features, functionality and enjoyment.
