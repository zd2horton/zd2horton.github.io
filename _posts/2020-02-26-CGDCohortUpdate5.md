As of now, the script now contains a lot more pawn interaction. This includes many new functions including FindPawnLocations, which loops through the list of pawns to find each distance from the machine and deduce which is the closest in order to help the falling conditions. Due to the availability of the new interactions, groundwork has also been laid out for killing crushed pawns, such as using the PawnManager.Instance.RemovePawn command to do this.
