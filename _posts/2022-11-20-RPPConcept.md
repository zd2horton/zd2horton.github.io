As of current I have been tinkering with the CGS solo project, wanting to make a bigger project out of such. My overarching want has been to make a platforming game that a group can play and have quick casual fun with, focused on more zany antics than a "competitive" angle that many games go for today. As well as this, I have especially wanted a colourful and vivid aesthetic that pops out, which so happens to also cross with a SNES inspired visual style that I would want over any other. This would overall be a more simple feeling game, which would harken back to the more concentrated fun factor of older games. Once I narrowed the potential rounds down to be lengths of around 1 to 3 minutes (following such games as SpeedRunners and Super Smash Bros.), a minigame collectathon idea was able to take hold with the potential following elements:

- A local multiplayer experience of up to eight players in one game
- Collect the most of an important item to either a certain amount or until time runs out
- A number of maps that randomly spawn the items in different locations if picked up
 
Though currently very simple in nature, more elements will be added over time as the idea develops. In terms of Unity development, the highest priority would be to expand on the pre-existing character controller and create more refined and satisfying movement.
