As of current, jumping is the current focus in terms of what to improve. Ideally, it should be a free yet tightly controlling arc that has weight to it, similar to those seen in older platformers (examples being Super Mario Bros. 3 and 2 in terms of potential freeness and tightness respectively). Currently, it has a very loose feeling arc that is only goes up a small amount, only dictated through adding a jump value to the player's Y vector (shown in Fig. 1). 

After reviewing a number of sources, I believe the best direction for the jump would be to apply an initial jump velocity, but also apply an additional downward air acceleration per frame on top of the velocity so that the jump feels more weighted over time, creating a more natural and fair arc that should feel satisfying to use. Alongside this, the game would also benefit from a more flexible system where the jump is affected by how long the player holds the button down, providing a wider range of maneuverability especially if the player desires a much shorter or higher jump depending on their circumstances (possibilities shown in Fig. 2). Implementation for this may be similar to the pre-existing code, however it will need to account for the downward acceleration and the factor of the jump button being held.

In terms of the overall game concept, lives and HP may be beneficial for the overall game loop as to breed more interactivity between players rather than having them simply race for each item and not cross paths. Items and powers would also play into this, creating scenarios where players would be able to use them to boost their own performance or slow others in order to get an advantage. Overall, many concepts could be added to the idea due to its simplicity, allowing it to gain some depth if various aspects are used in right ways.
