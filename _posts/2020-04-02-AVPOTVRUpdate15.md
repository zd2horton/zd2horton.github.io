As of today, most of the audio for the bandit scene has been implemented. The harsh wind is positioned closer to the dangerous exit of the map so that as players get closer, the wind will get more intense. As well as this, audio for snow travelling and the bandits' burning wagons have been placed in, though audio will need to change for when the wagon speeds up in the scene (which can be done externally). While horse whinnying and wagon crashing audio exist, they need to be edited to fit with the rest of the experience's clips. 

Another factor to try and fix is the travelling audio in the scenes when the wagon stops. For some reason, the nav mesh does not seem to stop so this will need to be inquired about. To add onto this and the pre existing cutting off issue in some clips, the universal asset for the wagon also needs to be added to so that the same initiation process for the wagon's audio does not have to be undertaken each time audio is implemented into a new scene. From here, less impactful issues can be looked at, namely the addition of royalty free music and other lesser audio clips in order to flesh the scenes out.
