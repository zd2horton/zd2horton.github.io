I have planned out the majority of my level, which will be a temple themed level with more puzzle oriented than the other levels being created in the project. It will start out with a timed switch and door sequence mixed with platforms that the player will need to descend down in time, before going into the main temple room to battle slimes and then requiring a puzzle in the next room in order to get the treasure chest. From there, the next room will be a timed stepping stones puzzle in which the player needs to step on different blocks in a specific order in order for the exit to open and complete the game. Overall, I believe that I will be able to implement these ideas without much trouble.
