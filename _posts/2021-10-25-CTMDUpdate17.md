The step limit has now been doubled to one million, resulting in the agent being far more successful in jumping over the obstacle. However, in earlier runs the agent would often overshoot and miss the coin entirely, consequently travelling through an area unintended for it and thus giving an unneeded negative reward to the system. This was remedied through creating a column of coins for the agent to collide into and resulting in flawless learning from the run, this result then being able to be used for a similar outcome with a two block stairway.
