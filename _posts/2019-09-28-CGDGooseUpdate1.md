As of the moment, many in our group have begun aspects of the game such as goose movement and NPC behaviour. Currently, I have created many sprites for potential NPCs as well as various items that could be used in the game. The sprites made are similar sizes to those that featured in the Atari 2600 library of games and also feature its NTSC colour palette. For the NPCs, I took inspiration from the appearance of the player character in the Atari 2600 videogame Pitfall, as it provides a reliable human like frame to work from.

Some of the sprites created for the NPCs that will appear in the game:
