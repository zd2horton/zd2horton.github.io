As of now, the target coin has been placed on the same platform so the agent does not need to jump. Though problematic at the beginning as expected, the agent was also by the end able to collect the coin without much trouble. This was done with coins both behind and in front of the player, though attempts to have two coins simultaneously be targets did not generally fare well as the agent would be too aimless in its movements and would also not have enough positive outcome to close the episode.

As for report progress, Overleaf has been chosen due to general ease of use as well as its overall viability for easy alterations. Currently, headings have been made alongside notes on what is required for each section, with some intended initial research around play quality being prepared for some of a research subsection on the paper.
