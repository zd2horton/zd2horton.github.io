In this week's session, we were given the game of Ludo in which four players move pieces from their "home" and work clockwise in order to have all of their 4 pieces journey into the middle of the board. In order to vary gameplay and apply a new coat of paint to the game, we attempted such ideas as only having to roll an even number in order to summon a new piece (this helped quicken the pace of play) and playing two versus two, in which players roll like normal however they and the player opposite them work together in order to place in total four of their total pieces in the middle.  We adopted the previous idea of rolling evens to summon a new piece and also placed a new rule in which a player in their turn is able to allocate the number of spaces they roll in any desired manner onto not only their own pieces but also their teammate's. This freshened up the game and also incorporated a new strategy which made the game a lot more about offense.
