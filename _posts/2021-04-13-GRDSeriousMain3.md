After today's session, the Bio-Rover has been assigned. With this, as mentioned previously a vast amount of potential can be realised with the mechanics of the Rover and the level design that would conform around them. Various ideas have been discussed as of current, most notably the inclusion of a planetary locale which could in turn heavily test the Rover's capabilities due to its uneven and crater esque qualities. As well as this, gameplay based implementations such as shadows and/or streetlights depending on the time of day, collecting and placing of key objects and pressing switches were also discussed as possible features of the game.
