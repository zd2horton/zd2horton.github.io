The final project that I have finished with bares some resemblance to my original plans with all 4 areas implemented, however there is a major amount of improvement that I could give. The most troubling seems to be that after playtests, a number of people refer to the more hardcore platforming implemented, perhaps discouraging play. This is most apparent with the climb up to the building implemented in the town of the level, as making a mistake can cause the player to drop back down the bottom forcing them to climb up again. This can become extremely frustrating over time and hinder enjoyment. This could have been mostly fixed by affixing the staircase closer to the building, making it less likely for players to fall off. 

As well as this, some aesthetic elements that were part of planning such as weather in the town and an opening and closing cutscene could have been implemented. These factors could also have been aided by a planned dialogue system which would have changed the villagers from tired and useless to more aware and frightened of their surroundings once the Sleeper was awoken. Another aspect that could be improved would be the level's lighting: this is most apparent in the cave section of the level, where although there is a large pool of lava it is hard to see the player character. I feel that more dynamic lighting could have been used to improve the overall lighting, as well as the cave area so that both the player and shards would be more visible.

I was proud with implementing the hook needed in the final level, however this could also have been improved via more visual improvements and retraction perhaps via mouse scroll. Overall, while I am pleased that the level is of a decent standard, more complex implementations and features could have been placed inside, and more playtests would have also benefitted the project in making it more worthwhile for the player to play.

The final area of the level in which the player must move obstacles in order to get to the treasure:
