## About Me
I am a recent Game Development graduate from UWE Bristol, with a 2:1 in the Games Technology Bachelors and a Merit in the Commercial Games Development Masters. I'm especially passionate for level design and game mechanics alongside their theory, as well as overall gameplay programming. I have developed these to further heights, especially in university where I was provided with industry-esque experience and tasks through PlayWest. 

My time there provided an invaluable experience that affirmed my aspirations and helped explore areas I never considered while in my comfort zone, building me up further to be an extremely ambitious, hard-working and creative individual. Overall, I have loved the industry from a young age and am incredibly keen to make experiences similar to those I've enjoyed over the years, especially through my current independent projects.
